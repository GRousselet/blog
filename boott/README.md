R code and notebook for my [blog post][1] on comparing the bootstrap-t technique:

R notebooks to reproduce all the figures:
- [ptb](docs/ptb.md) (first part)
- [ttestcov](docs/ttestcov.md) (closer look section)

Extra functions not available in packages are defined in text files in the `functions` folder.
Simulation results are in the `data` folder.
