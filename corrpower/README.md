R code and notebook for my [blog post](https://garstats.wordpress.com/2018/06/29/corrpower/) on power estimation for correlation analyses:

The notebook is available [here](docs/corr_power.md).

The R code is in `corr_power.Rmd`; datasets of simulation results are in the `data` folder, to be able to reproduce the figures without running the simulations.
