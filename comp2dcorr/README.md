Matlab code for my blog post on how to compare dependent correlations:
<https://garstats.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/comp2dcorr/>

`comp2dcorr.m` generates all the figures presented in the post, and a few extra figures generated by the Spearman function.

## Dependencies
To run the code, you will need the Robust Correlation Toolbox:

<https://sourceforge.net/projects/robustcorrtool/>
