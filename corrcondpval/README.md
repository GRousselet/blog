R code and notebook for my [blog post](https://garstats.wordpress.com/2018/06/22/corrcondpval/) on correlation estimation from small samples:

The notebook is available [here](docs/corr_pval.md).

The R code is in `corr_pval.Rmd`; datasets of simulation results are in the `data` folder, to be able to reproduce the figures without running the simulations.
