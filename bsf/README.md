R code and notebook for my blog post on the Bayesian shift function:
<XXX>

The notebook is available [here](docs/bsf.md).

The R code is in `bsf.Rmd`.

The `.RData` files contain results, to speed things up if you want to interact with the code without running slow chunks. These files will need to be in your working directory, along with the R code.
