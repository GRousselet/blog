R code for my blog post on the shift function:
<https://garstats.wordpress.com/2016/07/12/shift-function/>

`shift_function_demo.R` generates all the figures presented in the post.

All the dependencies are listed at the beginning of the file: 
in addition to packages `ggplot2` & `cowplot`, a few house-made toolboxes are provided as text files,
which are available here:

The main R functions are available on Rand Wilcox’s [website](http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/rwilcox/software/) - I’ve included the official current version, as of writing, as `Rallfun-v30.txt`. 
Datasets are either generated in the demo file, or loaded from text files - ensure all the files in this folder are in your working directory.

You can see the shift function in action here for instance:
