R code and notebook for my [blog post](https://garstats.wordpress.com/2018/09/06/cluster/) on cluster correction for multiple dependent comparisons:

The R notebook defining the basic functions and illustrating the examples with 5 and 7 groups is available [here](docs/cluster_cmc_tests.md). 

The R notebook to perform the simulations and illustrate the FWER and power results is [here](docs/cluster_cmc_sim.md).

The matching R code is in `cluster_cmc_tests.Rmd` and `cluster_cmc_sim.Rmd`.

The bootstrap and cluster functions are in this [text file](code/functions.txt).
