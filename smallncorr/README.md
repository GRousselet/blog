R code and notebook for my [blog post](https://garstats.wordpress.com/2018/06/01/smallncorr/) on correlation estimation from small samples:

The notebook is available [here](docs/corr_sim.md).

The R code is in `corr_sim.Rmd`; datasets of simulation results are in the `data` folder, to be able to reproduce the figures without running the simulations.

The results above are for Pearson’s correlation. Similar results were obtained using [Spearman’s correlation](docs/corr_sim_spearman.md).
