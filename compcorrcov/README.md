R code and notebook for my [blog post](https://garstats.wordpress.com/2019/07/12/compcorrcov/)
on coverage of confidence intervals for differences between correlation coefficients:

The notebook is available [here](docs/coverage_test.md).

The Rmarkdown code is in `coverage_test.Rmd`.

Simulation results are in the `data` folder.

Extra stats and plot functions are available in the `functions` folder.
