R code and notebook for my blog post on bootstrap bias correction:
<https://garstats.wordpress.com/2018/01/23/bias-correction/>

`bcdemo.Rmd` generates all the figures presented in the post, and the notebook `bcdemo.pdf`.

`akerd.txt` contains functions to generate kernel density estimates.
The code is from Rand Wilcoxâ€™s much larger `Rallfun-v34.txt`, available [here](http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/rwilcox/software/).
