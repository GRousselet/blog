R code + figures for my blog posts on alpha and power in the one-sample case:
<https://garstats.wordpress.com/2017/11/28/your-alpha-is-probably-not-0-05/ >
<https://garstats.wordpress.com/2017/11/28/your-power-is-lower-than-you-think/>

Two RMarkdown notebooks generate all the figures presented in the post:
`onesample_sim1.Rmd``onesample_sim2.Rmd`

`Rallfun-v34.txt` contains stats and graphs functions from Rand Wilcox.

Three RData files contain results of the simulations, so you donâ€™t need to run them again to recreate the figures.
