R code and notebook for my [blog post][1] on comparing two independent Pearsonâ€™s correlations:

R notebooks to reproduce all the figures:
- [g&h](docs/g&h.md)
- [compcorr](docs/compcorr.md)
- [normpower](docs/normpower.md)

Extra functions not available in packages are defined in text files in the `functions` folder.
Simulation results are in the `data` folder.
