R code and notebook for my [blog post][1] on comparing two independent Pearsonâ€™s correlations:

R notebooks to reproduce all the figures:
- `g&h.Rmd`
- `compcorr.Rmd`  
- [normpower](docs/normpower.md)

Extra functions not available in packages are defined in text files in the `functions` folder.
